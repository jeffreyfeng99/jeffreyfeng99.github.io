paragraph_txt: "Below are two examples of applying machine learning to graphical tasks in Houdini. These examples were created to demonstrate how users can effectively leverage PDG in their machine learning workflows, allowing for enhanced data synthesis, parallelism, hyperparameter space searching, data preprocessing, and visualization. A video can be found <a href='https://youtu.be/w-8qrehON8Q?t=3277'>here</a>."
