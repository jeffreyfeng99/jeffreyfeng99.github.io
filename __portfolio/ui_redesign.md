paragraph_txt: "Infusion pumps are medical devices that administer fluids, usually containing drugs, into a person’s body for medical treatment or therapy. These systems have been found to suffer from various shortcomings in the human factors scope. A task analysis was performed, followed by an analysis of cognitive and physical factors concerning the infusion pumps. Results from examining the operator’s manual, pre-pump activities, the keypad design, visual shortcomings, alarms and alerts, and stress and workload were incorporated into a proposed redesign of the Alaris Model 8220 Masimo Set infusion pump. Key features of the redesign included a restructuring of the alert system, the integration with a mobile application, and an improved user interface that reduced the amount of errors. </br></br> Below are just a few of the sample images from the report."
