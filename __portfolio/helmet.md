paragraph_txt: "The design propmpt was 'Child Sport Safety.' The discovered problem statement was: though bike helmet regulations specify requirements for the functional ability of helmets and helmets undergo strict testing to meet standards before being released as products, many designs fail to consider childrenâ€™s common inability to properly adjust the helmets. Though a helmet may have proper functionality under ideal circumstances, the true functionality depends on the abilities of the users. The primary factor that affects the proper usability of helmets is the method of adjustment. Often, children are unable to properly adjust their helmets due the strap being difficult to adjust, which impedes the standard functionality of the helmet. In some cases, children even resort to not using a helmet. The design that we developed is a crank device that turns to respectively loosen and tighten the strap. The finished product provides a means for children, especially for children who struggle with the current means of helmet strap adjustment, to independently ensure themselves of standard levels of safety."
