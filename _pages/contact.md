  As an emerging undergraduate student and biomedical engineer, I find myself discovering interest in many different fields. One of my current interests involves medical imaging, as I study ahead on Pattern Recognition and Imaging Analysis in hopes of attaining a relevant future co-op position.
  

  Meanwhile, I maintain interest in machine learning and space exploration. In my freetime, I can be found experimenting on Leetcode, exploring endless tutorials from deep learning to React, practicing guitar, attempting to improve my SolidWorks skills, exploring both website and game development.
  

  My favourite sport is soccer, and I try my best to play it as much as I can (or at least exercise on a regular basis). After all for someone who is pursing a path deeply entwined in healthcare, it would be rather hypocritical to dismiss the requirements of my own health.
